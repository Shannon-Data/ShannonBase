   * @brief Write a parsed change record into the population buffer or a remote stream.
   *
   * This function serves as the main data ingestion entry point for the Rapid
   * log population subsystem. Depending on the input target, it either:
   *   - Appends the change record into the in-memory buffer (`sys_pop_buff`),
   *     to be consumed later by the background populator thread (`parse_log_func_main()`), or
   *   - Sends the change record to a remote sink (e.g., distributed node, log replicator)
   *     â€” currently marked as TODO.
   *
   * @param[in] file
   *   Target output stream. If `nullptr`, the record will be pushed into
   *   `sys_pop_buff`. Otherwise, it represents a writable file handle or
   *   network stream (future extension).
   *
   * @param[in] start_lsn
   *   The starting LSN (Log Sequence Number) corresponding to this change
   *   record. It serves as the unique key for indexing `sys_pop_buff`.
   *
   * @param[in,out] changed_rec
   *   The change record buffer, which contains serialized redo or copy-info
   *   data produced by the log parsing or change-capture layer.
   *   Ownership of the buffer is moved into the population subsystem.
   *
   * @return
   *   `ShannonBase::SHANNON_SUCCESS` (always success currently),
   *   since this function is synchronous and only performs local memory operations.
   *
   * @note
   * - When `file == nullptr`, this function transfers ownership of `changed_rec`
   *   into the global `sys_pop_buff` and increases the global memory usage counter
   *   `sys_pop_data_sz` atomically.
   * - The background thread (`rapid_log_coordinator`) periodically monitors
   *   the buffer size and launches worker threads to process and propagate
   *   these buffered changes.
   * - Thread safety is guaranteed by `rapid_populator_mutex` when the buffer
   *   is concurrently consumed and modified.
   * - When remote propagation is implemented, care must be taken to preserve
   *   LSN ordering guarantees and ensure durability.

   * population job is still ongoing. Otherwise, the population process for this

   * - Query planning: deciding whether to route a query to ShannonBase or InnoDB.
   * - Status monitoring: reporting progress of background population tasks.
