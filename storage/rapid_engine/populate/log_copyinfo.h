  /**
   * @brief Parse and apply change records from a binary copy buffer.
   *
   * This function iterates through a binary stream containing encoded change
   * records (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) generated during a population or replication
   * process. Each record is decoded into a `change_record_buff_t` structure, and
   * applied to the corresponding table.
   *
   * The function uses the provided `Rapid_load_context` to either retrieve an
   * already opened TABLE object or open one on-demand. Each record is then
   * dispatched to the corresponding handler:
   * - `parse_and_apply_insert()` for insert operations.
   * - `parse_and_apply_update()` for update operations.
   * - `parse_and_apply_delete()` for delete operations.
   *
   * Typical usage:
   * - During system startup or incremental load to replay change logs.
   * - When synchronizing data between primary storage and secondary population buffers.
   *
   * Error handling:
   * - If a table cannot be opened, the function logs an error via `sql_print_error`
   *   and skips the current record.
   * - The parser continues until all records in the buffer are processed or the
   *   end of buffer (`end_ptr`) is reached.
   *
   * @param[in]  context     Pointer to the current rapid load execution context,
   *                         which provides access to open tables and schema metadata.
   * @param[in]  oper_type   The type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) being parsed.
   * @param[in]  start         Pointer to the start of the binary buffer containing change records.
   * @param[in]  end_ptr     Pointer to the end of the binary buffer.
   * @param[in]  new_start   Pointer to the start of the binary buffer containing change records[table->record[0]].
   * @param[in]  new_end_ptr Pointer to the end of the binary buffer [table->record[1]].
   *
   * @return returns parsed bytes; or return 0 on error.
   *
   * @note The function assumes `parse_record_header()` advances `start` safely
   *       within bounds and that each parsed record includes valid schema/table
   *       identifiers.
   * @threadsafe Not thread-safe; caller must ensure single-threaded access to the
   *              provided `Rapid_load_context` instance.
