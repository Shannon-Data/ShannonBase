   The fundmental code for GenAI.

   Generates SQL queries using natural-language statements. The routine also
   runs the generated SQL statement and displays the result set. You can use
   this routine for generating and running SQL queries only for databases
   and tables that you have access to.

   The LLM-generated SQL statements might contain syntax errors.
   The routine automatically detects these errors, and retries the SQL
   generation until a syntactically valid SQL statement is generated,
   with a maximum of 3 generation attempts.
